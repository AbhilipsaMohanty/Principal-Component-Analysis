# Principal-Component-Analysis
### Objective
The primary objective of this assignment is to explore the effectiveness of PCA as a dimensionality reduction technique and to evaluate its impact on clustering results. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), application of clustering algorithms, and a comparison of results between the original and PCA-transformed datasets.

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Loading: Load the dataset and perform basic data exploration.
3. Feature Distribution: Examine the distribution of features using histograms, box plots, or density plots.
4. Correlation Analysis: Investigate correlations between features to understand relationships within the data.
### Task 2: Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
Standardization and PCA Implementation
1. Feature Standardization: Standardize the features to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
2. PCA Implementation: Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
3. Optimal Components: Determine the optimal number of principal components using techniques like scree plot or cumulative explained variance.
4. Data Transformation: Transform the original dataset into the principal components.
### Task 3: Clustering with Original Data
1. Clustering and Visualization
2. Clustering Algorithm: Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means) to the original dataset.
3. Visualization: Visualize the clustering results using appropriate plots.
4. Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the clustering performance using metrics such as silhouette score or Daviesâ€“Bouldin index.
### Task 4: Clustering with PCA Data
1. Clustering on PCA-Transformed Data
2. Clustering Algorithm: Apply the same clustering algorithm to the PCA-transformed dataset.
3. Visualization: Visualize the clustering results obtained from PCA-transformed data.
4. Comparison: Compare the clustering results from PCA-transformed data with those from the original dataset.
### Task 5: Comparison and Analysis
1. Comparative Analysis
2. Clustering Comparison: Compare the clustering results obtained from the original dataset and PCA-transformed data.
3. Observation and Analysis: Discuss any similarities or differences observed in the clustering results.
4. Impact of PCA: Reflect on the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering performance.
5. Trade-Off Analysis: Analyze the trade-offs between using PCA and clustering directly on the original dataset.
### Task 6: Conclusion and Insights
Summary and Recommendations
1. Key Findings: Summarize the key findings and insights from the assignment.
2. Practical Implications: Discuss the practical implications of using PCA and clustering in data analysis.
3.Recommendations: Provide recommendations for when to use each technique based on the analysis conducted.
